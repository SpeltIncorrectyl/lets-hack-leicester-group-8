# Themes:

- Supporting the circular economy
- Building communities through gamification
- Urban environment sustainability technologies

# Our ideas:

A lot of the main locations in Leicester have very bad looking shops, not well looked after.
Attracting negativity and ruining the reputation.
Building on the community through gamification to encourage people to look after the environment.

* App to give points for keeping clean

* QR Code to give feedback to certain areas, allows government to know which areas need attention. Sent to local city council as a report. Data analysis

* Allow people to request to create a QR code for an area.

* Incentives to make people actually scan and give constructive feedback, or just make poster pretty.
* Annoymous and seamless is best, quick to do.

## QR Code Idea

People can create pages on the website. Each page has a QR code which links directly to that webpage. Someone just scan the QR code and it takes them directly to the page. They can comment and like and discuss things and provide feedback.

*Must have seamless experience, no need for account, someone can just instantly interact with the product*

* Creative Qr code with slogans that people can recognise with red fonts  

* Upvote/downvote something.

### Potential Issues

* Spam - easy to post large amounts of content
* Sockpuppets - someone can imitate multiple people to make themselves seem more important

* Potential solution: filtering and summary reports so we don't have to see spam.
* Input validation on form.
